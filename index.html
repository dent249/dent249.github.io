    <P>
        I adopted patches about two years ago. She was the fattest cat that I could find at the shelter. I picked her becuase she walked right up to me and laid down next to me. At first I was not even trying to pick her as a cat. I had looked at plenty of other cats that I thought about picking and she wasn't even one of them. But as soon as I saw her I knew that she was the cat for me. She was super scared at first, but after a few days she really warmed up to me.
